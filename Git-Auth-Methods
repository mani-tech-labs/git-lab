SSH Authentication
--------------------
First time connecting, SSH asks to trust GitHub’s fingerprint → verify it matches GitHub’s official one, then accept.

Your computer stores GitHub’s fingerprint so it won’t ask again.

You need an SSH key pair (private key stays on your machine, public key goes to GitHub).

Add your public key to GitHub in Settings → SSH and GPG keys so GitHub can recognize you.

Once set up, you can test the connection to confirm GitHub trusts your key.

After both sides trust each other, you can clone, push, and pull without entering passwords.

Along with commands:
--------------------
Verify GitHub fingerprint → type yes if it matches official.

Generate key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com".

Copy public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.

Add key in GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys.

Test connection: ssh -T git@github.com.

Clone repo: git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git.
