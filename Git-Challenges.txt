Top Git Challenges Faced
=======================

1. Merge conflicts when multiple developers edit the same lines of code.
	Solution:
	1. Communicate with your team to avoid working on the same files/lines when possible.
	2. Before pushing your changes, run `git pull --rebase origin <branch-name>` to get the latest updates from the remote branch.
	3. If a conflict occurs, Git will pause and mark the conflicting files. Open the files and look for lines marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
	4. Edit the file to keep the correct changes and remove the conflict markers.
	5. After resolving, stage the file with `git add <filename>`.
	6. Continue the rebase with `git rebase --continue` or finish the merge with `git commit`.
	7. Push your changes with `git push origin <branch-name>`.

2. Accidentally committing sensitive information (like passwords or API keys).
	Solution:
	1. If you notice sensitive data in a commit, immediately change/rotate the exposed credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.).
	2. Remove the sensitive file or line from your project.
	3. Use `git filter-repo` (recommended) or `git filter-branch` to remove the sensitive data from the entire history:
		- Install filter-repo: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo
		- Run: `git filter-repo --path <filename> --invert-paths` to remove a file from history.
	4. Force push the cleaned history: `git push --force`.
	5. Add the sensitive file to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits.
	6. Notify your team about the change and credential rotation.

3. Resolving complex rebase conflicts.
	Solution:
	1. Start a rebase: `git rebase <branch>`.
	2. If a conflict occurs, Git will stop and show the conflicted files.
	3. Open the files, look for conflict markers, and manually resolve the differences.
	4. Stage the resolved files: `git add <filename>`.
	5. Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`.
	6. If you get stuck, abort the rebase: `git rebase --abort`.
	7. Use VS Code's merge editor for a visual way to resolve conflicts.

4. Recovering lost commits after a mistaken reset or rebase.
	Solution:
	1. Run `git reflog` to see a log of all recent actions and commit references.
	2. Find the commit hash you want to recover.
	3. To restore, use `git checkout <commit-hash>` to view the commit.
	4. Create a new branch from it: `git checkout -b recovered-branch`.
	5. Or use `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` to apply the commit to your current branch.

5. Handling large binary files or repositories with huge histories.
	Solution:
	1. Install Git LFS: https://git-lfs.github.com/ and run `git lfs install`.
	2. Track large files: `git lfs track "*.psd"` (replace with your file type).
	3. Add and commit as usual; large files will be stored with LFS.
	4. Run `git gc` to clean up repository history and reduce size.
	5. For huge histories, consider splitting the repo or archiving old branches.

6. Undoing a pushed commit on a shared branch.
	Solution:
	1. To undo a commit without rewriting history, use `git revert <commit-hash>`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes.
	2. If you must remove the commit from history (not recommended for shared branches), use `git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>` and then `git push --force`.
	3. Always communicate with your team before force pushing.

7. Managing multiple remotes and keeping them in sync.
	Solution:
	1. Add remotes: `git remote add upstream <url>` and `git remote add origin <url>`.
	2. Fetch from all remotes: `git fetch origin`, `git fetch upstream`.
	3. Push to a specific remote: `git push origin <branch>`, `git push upstream <branch>`.
	4. Use clear remote names and document their purpose.

8. Dealing with detached HEAD state and lost work.
	Solution:
	1. If you see "detached HEAD" in your terminal, you are not on a branch.
	2. To save your work, run `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.
	3. This creates a new branch from your current state, preserving your changes.

9. Cleaning up unnecessary branches and stale references.
	Solution:
	1. List local branches: `git branch`.
	2. Delete a local branch: `git branch -d <branch-name>` (use `-D` to force delete).
	3. List remote branches: `git branch -r`.
	4. Delete a remote branch: `git push --delete origin <branch-name>`.
	5. Prune stale references: `git remote prune origin`.

10. Fixing mistakes after a force push (`git push --force`).
	Solution:
	1. Notify your team immediately if you force pushed by mistake.
	2. Run `git reflog` to find the previous state of the branch before the force push.
	3. Use `git reset --hard <old-commit-hash>` to restore the branch locally.
	4. Push the restored branch: `git push --force`.
	5. Avoid force pushing to shared branches; use `git revert` for safer undo.

11. Restoring files deleted by accident.
	Solution:
	1. If you deleted a file but haven't committed, use `git restore <filename>` to bring it back.
	2. If you already committed the deletion, find the commit hash before deletion using `git log`.
	3. Restore the file from a previous commit: `git checkout <commit-hash> -- <filename>`.
	4. Add and commit the restored file: `git add <filename>` and `git commit -m "Restore deleted file"`.

12. Handling submodules and keeping them updated.
	Solution:
	1. To add a submodule: `git submodule add <repo-url> <path>`.
	2. To initialize and update submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
	3. To pull latest changes in submodules: `cd <submodule-path>` and run `git pull`.
	4. Commit submodule changes in the parent repo: `git add <submodule-path>` and `git commit -m "Update submodule"`.

13. Resolving issues with incorrect author information in commits.
	Solution:
	1. For the last commit, use `git commit --amend --author="Correct Name <email>"`.
	2. For older commits, run `git rebase -i <base-commit>` and mark the commit as "edit".
	3. Amend the commit: `git commit --amend --author="Correct Name <email>"`.
	4. Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`.
	5. Force push if the branch is shared: `git push --force`.

14. Troubleshooting authentication and permission errors with remotes.
	Solution:
	1. Check your remote URL: `git remote -v`.
	2. Make sure you have access to the remote repository.
	3. If using HTTPS, update your credentials (username/token) when prompted.
	4. For SSH, ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub/GitLab account.
	5. If issues persist, remove and re-add the remote: `git remote remove origin` then `git remote add origin <url>`.

15. Migrating repositories between platforms (e.g., GitHub to GitLab).
	Solution:
	1. Clone the existing repository: `git clone <old-repo-url>`.
	2. Add the new remote: `git remote add new-origin <new-repo-url>`.
	3. Push all branches and tags: `git push new-origin --all` and `git push new-origin --tags`.
	4. Update documentation and inform your team about the migration.

16. Rebasing a branch with many conflicts.
	Solution:
	1. Start the rebase: `git rebase <target-branch>`.
	2. When a conflict occurs, open the conflicted files and resolve them.
	3. Stage resolved files: `git add <filename>`.
	4. Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`.
	5. If overwhelmed, rebase in smaller increments (e.g., a few commits at a time).

17. Accidentally overwriting local changes with a pull.
	Solution:
	1. Before pulling, save your changes: `git stash`.
	2. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin <branch>`.
	3. Reapply your changes: `git stash pop`.
	4. Resolve any conflicts and commit your work.

18. Pushing to the wrong branch.
	Solution:
	1. If you pushed to the wrong branch, use `git log` to find the commit(s).
	2. Undo the commit(s) with `git revert <commit-hash>` or `git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>`.
	3. Push the branch: `git push origin <branch>`.
	4. Switch to the correct branch: `git checkout <correct-branch>` and push your changes there.

19. Losing work after a hard reset.
	Solution:
	1. Run `git reflog` to see all recent branch states.
	2. Find the commit hash before the reset.
	3. Restore the branch: `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`.
	4. Or create a new branch from the lost commit: `git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>`.

20. Handling file permission changes in cross-platform teams.
	Solution:
	1. Create a `.gitattributes` file in your repo root.
	2. Specify file types and permissions, e.g., `*.sh text eol=lf`.
	3. Commit the `.gitattributes` file to enforce consistent permissions.
	4. Educate your team about cross-platform differences and best practices.

21. Integrating Git with CI/CD pipelines and handling build failures due to code changes.
	Solution:
	1. Set up protected branches in your repository settings to prevent direct pushes.
	2. Require pull requests for merging changes to main branches.
	3. Integrate automated tests in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
	4. If a build fails, review the error logs, fix the code, and push updates.
	5. Ensure all tests pass before merging.

22. Managing monorepos with multiple teams and projects.
	Solution:
	1. Organize the monorepo with clear folder structures for each project.
	2. Use submodules or subtrees for external dependencies.
	3. Communicate team boundaries and responsibilities.
	4. Use code owners and review rules to manage changes.

23. Handling repository size limits in cloud platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
	Solution:
	1. Monitor repository size using platform tools.
	2. Archive or delete old branches that are no longer needed.
	3. Use Git LFS for large files.
	4. If the repo is too large, split it into smaller, focused repositories.

24. Enforcing commit message standards across teams.
	Solution:
	1. Set up a commit message template in your repo.
	2. Use tools like `commitlint` and Husky to enforce standards via pre-commit hooks.
